Extract Clips: The code takes an input video, clip ranges (start and end times), and an output directory. It iterates through the clip ranges, extracts those segments from the video, and saves them as separate video clips.

Crop and Merge Clips: If desired dimensions are provided (9 : 16), the code crops each extracted clip to fit the specified width and height. Then, it merges all the cropped clips into a single temporary video file.

Extract Audio: If an audio file isn't provided, the code extracts the audio from the original video and saves it as a separate audio file.

Merge Audio and Video (MoviePy): It uses the MoviePy library to merge the temporary video (or the original extracted clips if no cropping is done) with the audio file (original or extracted). This creates the final short video.

At the last I have used ChatGPT and Gemini (Ai Tools) To do this code. I just have given the instructions to do this and what to do and then I did some changes Thatâ€™s it and then I have created the video that video clips are generated form the code inside the temp_clips file usig clipchamp (Microsoft video editing tools) to do this.
